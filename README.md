# Hi, I’m Carlos =^._.^=

<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/13HBDT4QSTpveU/giphy.gif" height="100" align="right" />
I’m a computer science student at the University of Central Florida and an organizer of Knight Hacks, where we run one of the largest student hackathons in the world with over 1,000+ student attendees. I've interned at a couple small local startups and at UCF building systems to help streamline advising workflows.
<br>
<br>
A huge part of my life as a student and software engineer has been hackathons! So far i've attended 7 and won 4! These honestly aren't just events to me anymore, i've grown to love the hackathon community and have learned so much because of them. :)
<br>

Feel free to check out my projects! If you have a cool idea and wanna work together or get my input, just hit me up!!!! 😺
